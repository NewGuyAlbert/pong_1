  PONG - GODOT CHEATSHEET
============================

--- CORE CONCEPTS ---

Scene:  A scene is a reusable building block in Godot. It's a tree of nodes
        saved as a .tscn file. Everything in your game is a scene — the main
        level, a paddle, a ball, a UI menu. Scenes can be nested inside other
        scenes (called "instancing").

Node:   The basic unit in Godot. Each node has a specific purpose (display a
        sprite, detect collisions, play audio, etc.). You build scenes by
        combining nodes in a tree hierarchy.

--- WHY NODE2D FOR THE MAIN SCENE? ---

Node2D is the base node for all 2D games. It gives you a 2D coordinate system
(x goes right, y goes down). We use it as the root of our main scene because
Pong is a 2D game and we just need a container to hold our child nodes (paddles,
ball, walls, score label). It doesn't do much on its own — it's an organizer.

--- PROJECT STRUCTURE ---

scenes/
  game/
    main.tscn       → Main game scene (root scene, holds everything)
    main.gd         → Game logic: scoring, win condition, restart
  ball/
    ball.tscn       → Ball scene
    ball.gd         → Ball movement, bouncing, speed, reset, scoring detection
  paddle/
    paddle.tscn     → Paddle scene (reused for both players)
    paddle.gd       → Paddle movement, input handling, screen clamping
assets/
  sounds/
    paddle_hit.mp3  → Sound when ball hits a paddle
    wall_hit.mp3    → Sound when ball hits a wall
    scored.mp3      → Sound when a point is scored

--- COLLISION LAYERS ---

Layer 1: Walls (StaticBody2D)      → TopWall, BottomWall
Layer 2: Paddles (CharacterBody2D) → LeftPaddle, RightPaddle
Layer 3: Ball (CharacterBody2D)    → Ball

Ball is on layer 3, masks 1+2      → collides with walls and paddles
Paddle is on layer 2, masks 1+3    → collides with walls and ball

--- NODE TYPES USED ---

Node2D               - Base 2D node, used as a container/root
StaticBody2D          - A physics body that does NOT move (walls)
CharacterBody2D       - A physics body you move with code (paddles, ball)
CollisionShape2D      - Defines the hitbox shape; child of a physics body
ColorRect             - A simple colored rectangle (visuals for paddle/ball/center line)
Label                 - Displays text on screen (score)
AudioStreamPlayer2D   - Plays a sound in 2D space (paddle hit, wall hit, scored)

--- PHYSICS BODIES CHEAT SHEET ---

StaticBody2D      → Doesn't move. Other things bounce off it. (walls)
CharacterBody2D   → You control movement in code. (paddle, ball)
RigidBody2D       → Physics engine moves it (gravity, forces). Not used here.
Area2D            → Detects overlaps but doesn't collide. (triggers, pickups)

--- INPUT MAP ---

Built-in actions:
  ui_cancel (Escape)     → Quit the game

Custom actions (defined in Project Settings > Input Map):
  ui_restart (R)         → Restart the game (only works after a win)

Hardcoded keys (read directly in paddle.gd):
  W / S                  → Left paddle movement
  Up / Down arrows       → Right paddle movement

--- SIGNALS IN THIS PROJECT ---

signal scored(player: String)    → Declared in ball.gd
scored.emit("left")              → Ball emits when it exits right side
scored.emit("right")             → Ball emits when it exits left side
ball.scored.connect(_on_ball_scored)  → main.gd listens for it in _ready()

Signals are Godot's event system. A node emits a signal, other nodes listen.
This keeps code decoupled — the ball doesn't need to know about the score.

--- KEY GODOT FUNCTIONS USED ---

move_and_collide(motion)    → Move a body and return collision info (ball, paddle)
direction.bounce(normal)    → Reflect a vector across a surface normal (ball bounce)
get_viewport_rect().size    → Get the viewport dimensions as Vector2
get_tree().quit()           → Close the game
get_tree().reload_current_scene()  → Reload the current scene (restart)
get_tree().create_timer(t).timeout → Create a one-shot timer, await it
set_physics_process(false)  → Disable _physics_process on a node (freeze it)
clampf(value, min, max)     → Clamp a float between min and max
minf(a, b)                  → Return the smaller of two floats
randf_range(min, max)       → Random float in range
randi() % 2                 → Random 0 or 1 (coin flip)
Vector2.from_angle(radians) → Create a unit vector from an angle
Input.is_key_pressed(KEY)   → Check if a specific key is held down
event.is_action_pressed(a)  → Check if an input action was just pressed

--- GDSCRIPT BASICS ---

extends Node2D        → This script inherits from Node2D
func _ready():        → Called once when the node enters the scene
func _process(delta): → Called every frame (for visuals/input)
func _physics_process(delta): → Called every physics tick (for movement)
func _unhandled_input(event):  → Called for input not consumed by UI
@export var speed := 400.0    → Editable in the Inspector panel
@onready var ball = $Ball     → Gets a child node reference when ready
await <signal>                → Pause execution until a signal fires

--- FILE TYPES ---

.tscn     → Scene file (text format, describes node tree)
.gd       → GDScript file (your code)
.uid      → Godot's unique ID tracker (auto-generated, don't edit)
.godot    → Project settings (can edit via UI: Project > Project Settings)
.import   → Import settings for assets (auto-generated)

--- EDITOR SHORTCUTS ---

F5                → Run the project (plays main scene)
F6                → Run current scene only
Ctrl+S            → Save current scene
Ctrl+Shift+S      → Save all scenes
Ctrl+A            → Add a new child node to selected node

--- PROJECT SETTINGS ---

Viewport size:         1152 × 648
Renderer:              Forward Plus (D3D12 on Windows)
Background color:      Dark gray (0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
Main scene:            res://scenes/game/main.tscn

--- COORDINATE SYSTEM ---

Origin (0,0) is the TOP-LEFT of the screen.
X increases to the RIGHT.
Y increases DOWNWARD.
Our viewport is 1152 x 648 pixels.

So:
  Top-left corner     = (0, 0)
  Top-right corner    = (1152, 0)
  Bottom-left corner  = (0, 648)
  Center              = (576, 324)

--- GAME FLOW ---

1. Main scene loads → _ready() connects ball's scored signal
2. Ball resets to center, waits 1 second, launches in random direction
3. Players move paddles with W/S and Up/Down
4. Ball bounces off walls and paddles, speeding up each hit
5. When ball exits left/right edge → scored signal → score updates
6. Ball resets to center and re-launches
7. First player to 3 points wins → game freezes
8. Press R to restart, Escape to quit
