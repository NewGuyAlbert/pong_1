  PONG - GODOT CHEATSHEET
============================

--- CORE CONCEPTS ---

Scene:  A scene is a reusable building block in Godot. It's a tree of nodes
        saved as a .tscn file. Everything in your game is a scene — the main
        level, a paddle, a ball, a UI menu. Scenes can be nested inside other
        scenes (called "instancing").

Node:   The basic unit in Godot. Each node has a specific purpose (display a
        sprite, detect collisions, play audio, etc.). You build scenes by
        combining nodes in a tree hierarchy.

--- WHY NODE2D FOR THE MAIN SCENE? ---

Node2D is the base node for all 2D games. It gives you a 2D coordinate system
(x goes right, y goes down). We use it as the root of our main scene because
Pong is a 2D game and we just need a container to hold our child nodes (paddles,
ball, walls, score label). It doesn't do much on its own — it's an organizer.

--- COMMON NODE TYPES (used in this project) ---

Node2D            - Base 2D node, used as a container/root
StaticBody2D      - A physics body that does NOT move (walls, floors)
CharacterBody2D   - A physics body you move with code (paddles, ball)
CollisionShape2D  - Defines the hitbox shape; must be a child of a physics body
ColorRect         - A simple colored rectangle (we use these as visuals)
Label             - Displays text on screen

--- PHYSICS BODIES CHEAT SHEET ---

StaticBody2D      → Doesn't move. Other things bounce off it. (walls)
CharacterBody2D   → You control movement in code. (paddle, ball)
RigidBody2D       → Physics engine moves it (gravity, forces). Not used here.
Area2D            → Detects overlaps but doesn't collide. (triggers, pickups)

--- KEY SHORTCUTS ---

F5                → Run the project (plays main scene)
F6                → Run current scene only
Ctrl+S            → Save current scene
Ctrl+Shift+S      → Save all scenes
Ctrl+A            → Add a new child node to selected node

--- GDSCRIPT BASICS ---

extends Node2D        → This script inherits from Node2D
func _ready():        → Called once when the node enters the scene
func _process(delta): → Called every frame (for visuals/input)
func _physics_process(delta): → Called every physics tick (for movement)
@export var speed := 400.0    → Editable in the Inspector panel
@onready var ball = $Ball     → Gets a child node reference when ready

--- SIGNALS ---

Signals are Godot's event system. A node emits a signal, other nodes listen.
Example: the ball emits "scored" when it leaves the screen, and the main
scene listens and updates the score. This keeps code decoupled.

signal scored(player: int)    → Declare a signal
scored.emit(1)                → Fire the signal
ball.scored.connect(_on_ball_scored)  → Listen for it

--- FILE TYPES ---

.tscn     → Scene file (text format, describes node tree)
.gd       → GDScript file (your code)
.uid      → Godot's unique ID tracker (auto-generated, don't edit)
.godot    → Project settings
.import   → Import settings for assets (auto-generated)

--- COORDINATE SYSTEM ---

Origin (0,0) is the TOP-LEFT of the screen.
X increases to the RIGHT.
Y increases DOWNWARD.
Our viewport is 1152 x 648 pixels.

So:
  Top-left corner     = (0, 0)
  Top-right corner    = (1152, 0)
  Bottom-left corner  = (0, 648)
  Center              = (576, 324)
