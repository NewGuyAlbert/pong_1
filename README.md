# Pong

A classic Pong game built with [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/).
This project is for personal learning.

## TODOs

- Check for inconsistent solutions across project.
- Add sounds for button hovers and clicks. Make menu interactible with arrow keys and Enter key.
- Make the game work for multiple screen sizes. Also some pixel values are hardcoded. Implement settings menu.
- Add AI opponent. (easy, medium, hard)
- Make it playable with controllers. (On most of the main platforms eg: Windows, Linux, Mac)
